Hello friends. I am Vanaya and I have great passion for art and graphic design. I possess a wide range of abilities that combine innovative art and design principles.
With more than 3 years experience as a Graphic Designer, I am adept in concept design, project management, and final design implementations. Moreover, while my on-the-job
experience has afforded me a well-rounded skill set, including first-rate multi-tasking and communication abilities, I excel at:

1. Designing layouts, producing images, and developing styles for websites, social media profiles and corporate communications
2. Contributing creative ideas during corporate brainstorming sessions
3. Prioritizing workloads and coordinating multiple ongoing projects

Furthermore, my expert knowledge of DaVinci Resolve 16, Gimp, Inkscape and Fushion Studio 9 will allow me to play a crucial role in the implementation of your design initiatives.
